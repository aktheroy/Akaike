Its stock has surged nonetheless, rising by more than 50% since President Donald Trump was elected, on investor optimism that Musk’s advisory role in the new administration will help the company.\\n\\nIn its letter to shareholders and on the analyst call, Tesla it was hoping to lift sales by driving the cost of its vehicles down, highlighting that one cost measure fell below $35,000, the lowest in its history. It said production of “more affordable” models are expected to start in the first half of the year, with Musk emphasizing that “maximizing volume” was priority.\\n\\nBut then he quickly pivoted in the conference call to other goals and parts of the business, and the stock started climbing.\\n\\n“AI and robotics - that will bear immense fruit,” he said, adding “I see a path, I’m not saying it’s an easy path, but I see a path for Tesla being the most valuable company in the world — by far, not even close,” leapfrogging the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Tesla is currently the seventh-most valuable company in the S&P 500 with a market value of $1.25 trillion.\\n\\nTesla’s unadjusted profits for October through December period were down dramatically, though the year-earlier period was a poor comparison because the results included a large one-time tax benefit. The company said it made $2.31 billion last quarter, down 71% from the $7.93 billion profit in the same period in 2023.\\n\\nRevenue rose 2% to $25.7 billion, less than Wall Street’s forecast of $27.1 billion, according to FactSet. Tesla offered a series of incentives during the quarter to drum up demand for its electric vehicles including low-interest loans and lower prices. Tesla’s gross profit margin fell to 16.3% for the quarter, down 1.3 percentage points from a year earlier.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Tesla said it sold 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, the first drop in more than a dozen years despite offers of 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. The fourth quarter showed signs of a rebound, though, with a record 495,570 vehicles sold.\\n\\n“The bulls got what they wanted, and the bears got data to support them as well,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a big fan of the stock. “But ultimately what will drive the stock is autonomous driving, and this is the bullish I’ve ever heard Musk.”\\n\\nFor the full year, Tesla posted profits before one-time items of $8.42 billion, down 23% from the year earlier.\\n\\nInvestors are expecting that Musk’s close relationship with Trump will translate into lighter regulation on the car company, fewer investigations and help in speeding the development of autonomous driving.\\n\\nBut the Trump administration has also vowed to cut government incentives to customers to buy EVs and says it will loosen emission standards. The latter especially could hurt Tesla because it has a big business in selling “regulatory credits” to other automakers that fall short of the standards.\\n\\nThe latest financial report showed that in the fourth quarter Tesla sold $692 million in these credits, a spigot of cash that could be turned off if Trump follows through on his vow.', 'Topics': ['tesla offered', 'tesla sold', 'tesla', 'hurt tesla', 'quarter tesla'], 'Sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'Title': \"Attorney general calls Tesla arson attacks 'nothing short of domestic terrorism'\", 'Summary': 'A member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is calling the recent spate of arson attacks and vandalism against Tesla vehicles \"nothing short of domestic terrorism\" and promising harsh punishments for perpetrators if they are caught.', 'Content': 'A member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is calling the recent spate of arson attacks and vandalism against Tesla vehicles \"nothing short of domestic terrorism\" and promising harsh punishments for perpetrators if they are caught.\\n\\nThe statement from Bondi came after the latest incident in which five Tesla vehicles were damaged when a fire was started at a Tesla Collision Center in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning. That was the latest in a wave of incidents aimed at the electric vehicle company, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\\n\\n\"This was a targeted attack against a Tesla facility,\" said Dori Koren, assistant sheriff for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\\n\\nAlong with the burning vehicles, officials said the word \"RESIST\" was spray-painted across the doors of the facility and three rounds of shots were fired at the additional Teslas. The suspect approached the business wearing black clothing and are believed to have used Molotov cocktails and a firearm to conduct his attack, police said.\\n\\nOfficials received notice that an individual had \"set several vehicles on fire in the parking lot and caused damage to the property.\"\\n\\nPolice and the FBI\\'s Joint Terrorism Task Force are investigating this incident, which they believe was an isolated attack. Authorities are still searching for a suspect.\\n\\nTwo Tesla Cybertrucks also caught on fire at a dealership in Kansas City, Missouri, on Monday evening, according to the Kansas City Police Department.\\n\\nTesla vehicles, dealerships and charging stations have been vandalized, suffered arson and faced protests in recent weeks since the company\\'s CEO Elon Musk began his work at the White House spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\\n\\nIn the statement Tuesday, Bondi said, “The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" In some of the cases, she said the Justice Department is charging perpetrators with crimes that carry five-year mandatory minimum sentences.\\n\\n\"We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,\" she said in the statement.\\n\\nIn the Kansas incident, a police officer in the area spotted smoke coming from one Cybertruck at a Tesla dealership on State Line Road shortly before midnight. The officer attempted to put out the flames using a fire extinguisher, but the fire spread to a second Cybertruck parked next to the original one, police said.\\n\\nChalk graffiti is displayed on the outside of a Tesla dealership during a rally in San Francisco, March 15, 2025.

Officials were able to put out the flames and the vehicles were \"covered with a fire blanket to prevent reignition,\" the fire department said.\\n\\n\"The circumstances are under investigation but preliminarily the fire is being investigated for the potential of being an arson,\" police said in a statement on Monday.\\n\\nThere have been no arrests made for this incident, police said. The FBI is assisting the Kansas City Police Department in this investigation.\\n\\nThis follows a spree of similar incidents that have occurred across the country in the last few weeks.\\n\\nLast week, \"more than a dozen\" shots were fired at a Tesla dealership in Tigard, Oregon, according to Kelsey Anderson, the public information officer at the Tigard Police Department.\\n\\nAdditionally, three Teslas were vandalized in Dedham, Massachusetts on March 11, according to the Dedham Police Department. Officials said \"words had been spray-painted\" on two Tesla Cybertrucks, with all four tires of the trucks and a Tesla Model S being \"reportedly damaged.\"\\n\\nATF investigators inspect burned Tesla Cybertrucks at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025. Lindsey Wasson/AP\\n\\nProtests against the company have also occurred at dealerships nationwide.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\\n\\nNew York CNN —\\n\\nElon Musk’s DC power grab hasn’t been the Tesla-stock jet fuel investors were expecting.\\n\\nTesla shares have fallen more than 40% since January — erasing all of the “Trump bump” that briefly saw the stock gain more than 90% after Election Day. Musk, whose wealth is overwhelmingly linked to his Tesla holdings, has personally lost $121 billion from his net worth over the past three months.\\n\\nSo what happened? Why hasn’t Musk’s rapid ascent into oligarch territory helped rescue his “baby” (as President Trump called Tesla during the pair’s bizarre ad-like press conference last week on the South Lawn)?\\n\\nThere are two main reasons:\\n\\nTesla sales are cratering around the world, and… Its CEO isn’t doing anything to stop it.\\n\\nWhile Musk is holed up in the EEOB looking for ways to break the federal government, Tesla’s core business is in crisis.\\n\\nThe company reported its first-ever drop in global sales last year, and this year isn’t looking much better. Wall Street analysts from RBC, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Mizuho and JPMorgan have all lowered their delivery forecasts for the company.\\n\\nIn China, in particular, Tesla is struggling to compete against domestic carmakers. Last month Tesla shipments in the country fell 49% year-over-year. Europe sales are also slumping, particularly in Germany, where consumers have been outraged over Musk’s support of a far-right nationalist party with links to Nazis. Sales tumbled 76% in Germany last month from a year earlier.\\n\\nThe news isn’t getting better for Tesla. Its stock got a double-shot of bad news out of China on Monday.\\n\\nIts No. 1 Chinese rival, BYD, unveiled a new charging system that can give its latest model cars 250 miles of ra\\ufeffnge after just five minutes — twice as fast as Tesla’s charging rate.\\n\\nOn the same day, Tesla also launched a free monthlong trial of its “Full Self-Driving” software in China — a sign the company is desperately trying to reverse is declining market share.\\n\\nIts shares fell 5% in the US on Monday and another 5% on Tuesday after RBC lowered its price target in response to growing domestic competition.\\n\\nAll those headaches would amount to a dire problem for Tesla even if it had a normal CEO. But Tesla is run by the MAGA-pilled Musk, whose personal brand has gone from “OK, he’s a bit weird” a few years ago to “OK, he’s posting racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories” in 2025.\\n\\nTesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nA CNN poll last week found that 53% of Americans have a negative view of Musk, while roughly 60% say he has neither the right experience nor the right judgment to make the kinds of sweeping cuts his “department” is carrying out.\\n\\nA used Cybertruck is selling for 58% less than it did a year ago on the resale market. Julio Cortez/AP\\n\\nWhile Tesla is still the best-selling electric vehicle brand in the US, competition is heating up, and Musk’s right-wing authoritarian turn appears to be doing real damage.\\n\\nPrices on pre-owned Teslas are falling at more than double the rate of the average car, according to research by CarGurus. Used cars overall have fallen 2.7% year over year, while used Teslas have declined 7.3%. A used Cybertruck, Tesla’s head-scratching experiment in car design that looks like it was based on a dare, is worth a whopping 58% less on the resale market.\\n\\nAnother report from Cars.com found that while searches for non-Tesla EVs were up 12% year-over-year last month, searches for Teslas have fallen 7%.\\n\\n“We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note to clients last week.\\n\\nAdding fuel to the backlash is a “Tesla Takedown” movement started by activists and spread on social media, advocating that people sell Tesla vehicles, dump the stock and protest at showrooms.\\n\\n“I’m getting rid of this car because I’m embarrassed to drive it,” Joe Romer, a Tesla owner in California, told CNN’s Julia Vargas Jones. “I’m tired of Elon Musk and all this garbage that’s going on.”\\n\\nEven Dan Ives, a tech analyst for Wedbush and historically one of Tesla’s biggest cheerleaders, appears to be losing patience with Musk.\\n\\nLast week, Ives wrote in a note to clients that while he is maintaining his “outperform” rating on the stock, investor patience is “wearing very thin.”\\n\\nBottom line: Wall Street has long been able to tolerate Musk because Tesla was a cutting-edge company with a product lots of people wanted to buy. Investors can look past all kinds of shenanigans if they’re getting a good return on investment.\\n\\nBut what happens when Tesla stops being the dominant player in electric vehicles? And what happens when Musk is too busy trying to fire federal workers to fix it? These are the kinds of questions rattling investors at a time when they already have plenty of nightmare fuel in the form of Trump’s economic agenda.\\n\\nMusk has made his name synonymous with Tesla — a fact that served them both well when Tesla seemed unstoppable and Musk became the world’s richest person.\\n\\nBut Tesla no longer seems unstoppable, and Musk no longer seems stable.

In addition to existing pressures, Tesla on Tuesday faced fresh competition from China and an analyst price-target cut.\\n\\nBelow are four forces — two new, two evergreen — driving the acceleration in Tesla\\'s share-price decline.\\n\\n1. BYD\\'s new battery tech\\n\\nThe Chinese firm BYD unveiled an EV-charging station that it claims can deliver up to 400 kilometers in driving range after just five minutes of charging. This would be a big step up from current charging technology, with Tesla\\'s quickest version providing a 275-kilometer range after 15 minutes of charging.\\n\\nThe development creates another headwind for Tesla as it tries to break into Chinese market.\\n\\nBYD plans to build 4,000 of these chargers across China.\\n\\n2. Wall Street scaling back forecasts\\n\\nThough RBC maintains an \"outperform\" rating on Tesla, it cut its price target to $320 from $440.\\n\\nThe analyst Tom Narayan expects lower pricing on Tesla\\'s full self-driving technology as autonomous offerings become increasingly standard across the EV industry. Meanwhile, given heightened competition in Europe and China, Narayan lowered robotaxi-penetration assumptions.\\n\\n\"As a result, we now lower our market share assumption to 10% from 20% in both markets,\" he wrote.\\n\\nRBC\\'s adjusted forecast adds to a growing string of downgrades plaguing Tesla. Last week, JPMorgan lowered its price target by about 41% to $135 per share, citing lower guidance on vehicle deliveries.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\n3. Slowing vehicle sales worldwide\\n\\nSales data this year has bolstered market gloom, with consumers sidestepping Tesla in favor of other EV competitors.\\n\\nChina shipments of Tesla vehicles fell 49% year-over-year in February. The company sold 30,688 Chinese-made vehicles, its lowest number since August 2022.\\n\\nA similar trend is showing up in Europe. January Tesla purchases in the region fell 45% from a year ago, compared to a 37% jump in overall European EV sales. The pattern continued into February, with sales in Germany falling by 76%.\\n\\n4. A distracted CEO\\n\\nIrritation is also growing with Tesla\\'s leadership, as investors question the priorities of CEO Elon Musk.\\n\\nMusk — whose firebrand image as a tech innovator helped propel the stock to past records — seems increasingly distant from the company, minting cynics out of Tesla\\'s old-time bulls.\\n\\nIn large part, investors have blamed his growing role in the Trump administration, with Musk heading the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency. He himself has noted \"great difficulty\" in dividing his attention between DOGE and his many companies, a statement investors were likely unhappy to hear.\\n\\n\"We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin, and it\\'s become clear he\\'s now spending more time on DOGE than anything else,\" Garrett Nelson, CFRA\\'s senior equity analyst, previously told BI.', 'Topics': ['tesla stock', 'tesla investors', 'tesla purchases', 'tuesday tesla', 'growing tesla'], 'Sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'Title': \"A Tesla protester targeted by Elon Musk speaks out: 'I have to protect myself'\", 'Summary': \"A Tesla protester targeted by Elon Musk speaks out: 'I have to protect myself'toggle caption Rodrique Ngowi/APValerie Costa never expected to be directly in Elon Musk's crosshairs, but here she is.\\nRecently, she has helped organize peaceful local protests as part of Tesla Takedown, demonstrations happening worldwide objecting to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's campaign of slashing and disrupting the federal government.\\nSponsor MessageCosta is afraid that Musk will use his White House power and influence to apply more pressure.\\nMusk and the White House did not return requests for comment.\\nThe Tesla Takedown protests are aimed at hurting the value of Tesla, the primary source of Musk's wealth, by encouraging people to boycott the company, Costa said.\", 'Content': 'A Tesla protester targeted by Elon Musk speaks out: \\'I have to protect myself\\'\\n\\ntoggle caption Rodrique Ngowi/AP\\n\\nValerie Costa never expected to be directly in Elon Musk\\'s crosshairs, but here she is.\\n\\nCosta, 43, is a community organizer in Seattle who co-founded an environmental activist group called the Troublemakers.

AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nKey Facts\\n\\nShares of Tesla dropped 5% to $225.31 Tuesday, building on Monday’s 5% dip as the stock appears poised to decline for a ninth consecutive week. Tuesday’s drop came as Musk’s firm faced yet another ding from Wall Street analysts. RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan cut his price target for Tesla stock by $120 to $320, maintaining his outperform rating for Musk’s company while “rightsizing expectations.” Narayan cited “intensifying” competition for Tesla in China, which accounted for 21% of Tesla’s 2024 sales, predicting Chinese car companies will “dominate” the market in the country for driverless vehicles, which Musk has emphasized as the future of his company. Driving down Tesla shares Monday was a note from Mizuho analysts led by Vijay Rakesh lowering their price target for Tesla shares by $85 to a still bullish $430, as the analysts slashed their 2025 vehicle delivery forecast from 2.3 million to 1.8 million, a more than 20% cut that falls well below consensus forecasts of 2 million deliveries. Rakesh chalked up Tesla’s “sales woes” to weakening “brand perception” in the U.S. and the European Union, a “deterioration in geopolitics” and increasingly challenging competition in China from domestic EV firms.\\n\\nNews Peg\\n\\nTwo of Tesla’s Chinese EV competitors made major announcements this week which may further weaken Tesla’s positioning in the country. BYD unveiled a new fast charging system which may charge cars in less than a third of the time Tesla’s current chargers allow, while Zeekr said it will offer its self-driving system for free in China. RBC said it expects Tesla’s market share in China to halve to 10%, and relatedly lowered its valuation for Tesla’s full self-driving and robotaxi units from $1.26 trillion to about $850 billion.\\n\\nSurprising Fact\\n\\nMizuho analysts said Tesla’s U.S. sales last month declined 2% year-over-year as the broader EV market rose by 16%, its China sales cratered 49% as EV sales in the country grew by 85% and its Germany sales tanked 76% as the European nation’s EV market expanded by 31%.\\n\\nKey Background\\n\\nTesla stock ended Friday trading at its lowest end-of-week level since just before the election. Shares of Tesla are down 44% year-to-date, the worst loss of any company listed on the S&P, according to FactSet data. Mizuho and RBC joined the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and UBS in slashing its delivery forecasts for Tesla. “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” Last week, JPMorgan analysts described the recent melting of Tesla’s perception, especially in pockets of the world in which Musk inserted himself into right-wing politics, such as Germany. Though Musk is perhaps the closest ally of President Donald Trump, the latter’s hawkish tariffs are a major drag on Musk’s main source of wealth, Tesla. In a letter to the Office of the United States Trade Representative submitted last Tuesday, Tesla lobbied the Trump administration to take a “phased approach” on tariffs and consider Tesla’s EVs contain “certain parts and components” which “are difficult or impossible to source within the United States,” a break from Trump’s frequently shifting tariff deadlines and targets. About 53% respondents to a CNN poll published last week said they hold a negative opinion of Musk compared to roughly 35% with a positive view and about 11% with no take.\\n\\nContra\\n\\nTesla stock is still up 1% from last Monday, when it suffered a 4.5-year-worst 15% amid a broader selloff tied to economic uncertainty fears linked to Trump’s tariffs.\\n\\nForbes Valuation\\n\\nMusk’s $321 billion net worth makes him easily the richest person on the planet, though that’s down more than $140 billion from its peak of $464 billion set in December when Tesla stock traded at about $480 following a post-election upward swing.\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n\\nForbes Why Tesla Isn’t The AI Powerhouse Musk Says It Is', 'Topics': ['tesla forbes', 'tesla stock', 'tesla sales', 'shares tesla', 'forbes valuationmusk'], 'Sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'Title': \"Attorney general calls Tesla arson attacks 'nothing short of domestic terrorism'\", 'Summary': 'A member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is calling the recent spate of arson attacks and vandalism against Tesla vehicles \"nothing short of domestic terrorism\" and promising harsh punishments for perpetrators if they are caught.', 'Content': 'A member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is calling the recent spate of arson attacks and vandalism against Tesla vehicles \"nothing short of domestic terrorism\" and promising harsh punishments for perpetrators if they are caught.\\n\\nThe statement from Bondi came after the latest incident in which five Tesla vehicles were damaged when a fire was started at a Tesla Collision Center in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\\n\\nNew York CNN —\\n\\nElon Musk’s DC power grab hasn’t been the Tesla-stock jet fuel investors were expecting.\\n\\nTesla shares have fallen more than 40% since January — erasing all of the “Trump bump” that briefly saw the stock gain more than 90% after Election Day. Musk, whose wealth is overwhelmingly linked to his Tesla holdings, has personally lost $121 billion from his net worth over the past three months.\\n\\nSo what happened? Why hasn’t Musk’s rapid ascent into oligarch territory helped rescue his “baby” (as President Trump called Tesla during the pair’s bizarre ad-like press conference last week on the South Lawn)?\\n\\nThere are two main reasons:\\n\\nTesla sales are cratering around the world, and… Its CEO isn’t doing anything to stop it.\\n\\nWhile Musk is holed up in the EEOB looking for ways to break the federal government, Tesla’s core business is in crisis.\\n\\nThe company reported its first-ever drop in global sales last year, and this year isn’t looking much better. Wall Street analysts from RBC, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Mizuho and JPMorgan have all lowered their delivery forecasts for the company.\\n\\nIn China, in particular, Tesla is struggling to compete against domestic carmakers. Last month Tesla shipments in the country fell 49% year-over-year. Europe sales are also slumping, particularly in Germany, where consumers have been outraged over Musk’s support of a far-right nationalist party with links to Nazis. Sales tumbled 76% in Germany last month from a year earlier.\\n\\nThe news isn’t getting better for Tesla. Its stock got a double-shot of bad news out of China on Monday.\\n\\nIts No. 1 Chinese rival, BYD, unveiled a new charging system that can give its latest model cars 250 miles of ra\\ufeffnge after just five minutes — twice as fast as Tesla’s charging rate.\\n\\nOn the same day, Tesla also launched a free monthlong trial of its “Full Self-Driving” software in China — a sign the company is desperately trying to reverse is declining market share.\\n\\nIts shares fell 5% in the US on Monday and another 5% on Tuesday after RBC lowered its price target in response to growing domestic competition.\\n\\nAll those headaches would amount to a dire problem for Tesla even if it had a normal CEO. But Tesla is run by the MAGA-pilled Musk, whose personal brand has gone from “OK, he’s a bit weird” a few years ago to “OK, he’s posting racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories” in 2025.\\n\\nTesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nA CNN poll last week found that 53% of Americans have a negative view of Musk, while roughly 60% say he has neither the right experience nor the right judgment to make the kinds of sweeping cuts his “department” is carrying out.\\n\\nA used Cybertruck is selling for 58% less than it did a year ago on the resale market. Julio Cortez/AP\\n\\nWhile Tesla is still the best-selling electric vehicle brand in the US, competition is heating up, and Musk’s right-wing authoritarian turn appears to be doing real damage.\\n\\nPrices on pre-owned Teslas are falling at more than double the rate of the average car, according to research by CarGurus. Used cars overall have fallen 2.7% year over year, while used Teslas have declined 7.3%. A used Cybertruck, Tesla’s head-scratching experiment in car design that looks like it was based on a dare, is worth a whopping 58% less on the resale market.\\n\\nAnother report from Cars.com found that while searches for non-Tesla EVs were up 12% year-over-year last month, searches for Teslas have fallen 7%.\\n\\n“We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note to clients last week.\\n\\nAdding fuel to the backlash is a “Tesla Takedown” movement started by activists and spread on social media, advocating that people sell Tesla vehicles, dump the stock and protest at showrooms.\\n\\n“I’m getting rid of this car because I’m embarrassed to drive it,” Joe Romer, a Tesla owner in California, told CNN’s Julia Vargas Jones. “I’m tired of Elon Musk and all this garbage that’s going on.”\\n\\nEven Dan Ives, a tech analyst for Wedbush and historically one of Tesla’s biggest cheerleaders, appears to be losing patience with Musk.\\n\\nLast week, Ives wrote in a note to clients that while he is maintaining his “outperform” rating on the stock, investor patience is “wearing very thin.”\\n\\nBottom line: Wall Street has long been able to tolerate Musk because Tesla was a cutting-edge company with a product lots of people wanted to buy. Investors can look past all kinds of shenanigans if they’re getting a good return on investment.\\n\\nBut what happens when Tesla stops being the dominant player in electric vehicles? And what happens when Musk is too busy trying to fire federal workers to fix it? These are the kinds of questions rattling investors at a time when they already have plenty of nightmare fuel in the form of Trump’s economic agenda.\\n\\nMusk has made his name synonymous with Tesla — a fact that served them both well when Tesla seemed unstoppable and Musk became the world’s richest person.\\n\\nBut Tesla no longer seems unstoppable, and Musk no longer seems stable.

AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nKey Facts\\n\\nShares of Tesla dropped 5% to $225.31 Tuesday, building on Monday’s 5% dip as the stock appears poised to decline for a ninth consecutive week. Tuesday’s drop came as Musk’s firm faced yet another ding from Wall Street analysts. RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan cut his price target for Tesla stock by $120 to $320, maintaining his outperform rating for Musk’s company while “rightsizing expectations.” Narayan cited “intensifying” competition for Tesla in China, which accounted for 21% of Tesla’s 2024 sales, predicting Chinese car companies will “dominate” the market in the country for driverless vehicles, which Musk has emphasized as the future of his company. Driving down Tesla shares Monday was a note from Mizuho analysts led by Vijay Rakesh lowering their price target for Tesla shares by $85 to a still bullish $430, as the analysts slashed their 2025 vehicle delivery forecast from 2.3 million to 1.8 million, a more than 20% cut that falls well below consensus forecasts of 2 million deliveries. Rakesh chalked up Tesla’s “sales woes” to weakening “brand perception” in the U.S. and the European Union, a “deterioration in geopolitics” and increasingly challenging competition in China from domestic EV firms.\\n\\nNews Peg\\n\\nTwo of Tesla’s Chinese EV competitors made major announcements this week which may further weaken Tesla’s positioning in the country. BYD unveiled a new fast charging system which may charge cars in less than a third of the time Tesla’s current chargers allow, while Zeekr said it will offer its self-driving system for free in China. RBC said it expects Tesla’s market share in China to halve to 10%, and relatedly lowered its valuation for Tesla’s full self-driving and robotaxi units from $1.26 trillion to about $850 billion.\\n\\nSurprising Fact\\n\\nMizuho analysts said Tesla’s U.S. sales last month declined 2% year-over-year as the broader EV market rose by 16%, its China sales cratered 49% as EV sales in the country grew by 85% and its Germany sales tanked 76% as the European nation’s EV market expanded by 31%.\\n\\nKey Background\\n\\nTesla stock ended Friday trading at its lowest end-of-week level since just before the election. Shares of Tesla are down 44% year-to-date, the worst loss of any company listed on the S&P, according to FactSet data. Mizuho and RBC joined the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and UBS in slashing its delivery forecasts for Tesla. “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” Last week, JPMorgan analysts described the recent melting of Tesla’s perception, especially in pockets of the world in which Musk inserted himself into right-wing politics, such as Germany. Though Musk is perhaps the closest ally of President Donald Trump, the latter’s hawkish tariffs are a major drag on Musk’s main source of wealth, Tesla. In a letter to the Office of the United States Trade Representative submitted last Tuesday, Tesla lobbied the Trump administration to take a “phased approach” on tariffs and consider Tesla’s EVs contain “certain parts and components” which “are difficult or impossible to source within the United States,” a break from Trump’s frequently shifting tariff deadlines and targets. About 53% respondents to a CNN poll published last week said they hold a negative opinion of Musk compared to roughly 35% with a positive view and about 11% with no take.\\n\\nContra\\n\\nTesla stock is still up 1% from last Monday, when it suffered a 4.5-year-worst 15% amid a broader selloff tied to economic uncertainty fears linked to Trump’s tariffs.\\n\\nForbes Valuation\\n\\nMusk’s $321 billion net worth makes him easily the richest person on the planet, though that’s down more than $140 billion from its peak of $464 billion set in December when Tesla stock traded at about $480 following a post-election upward swing.\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n\\nForbes Why Tesla Isn’t The AI Powerhouse Musk Says It Is', 'Topics': ['tesla forbes', 'tesla stock', 'tesla sales', 'shares tesla', 'forbes valuationmusk'], 'Sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'Title': 'Tesla Mag : EV News, Space and new energy transition', 'Summary': 'Ask for a Photovoltaic panels estimateAsk for a quote charging station', 'Content': 'Ask for a Photovoltaic panels estimate\\n\\nAsk for a quote charging station', 'Topics': ['photovoltaic panels', 'ask photovoltaic', 'photovoltaic', 'quote charging', 'panels estimateask'], 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, {'Title': \"Attorney general calls Tesla arson attacks 'nothing short of domestic terrorism'\", 'Summary': 'A member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is calling the recent spate of arson attacks and vandalism against Tesla vehicles \"nothing short of domestic terrorism\" and promising harsh punishments for perpetrators if they are caught.', 'Content': 'A member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is calling the recent spate of arson attacks and vandalism against Tesla vehicles \"nothing short of domestic terrorism\" and promising harsh punishments for perpetrators if they are caught.\\n\\nThe statement from Bondi came after the latest incident in which five Tesla vehicles were damaged when a fire was started at a Tesla Collision Center in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning. That was the latest in a wave of incidents aimed at the electric vehicle company, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\\n\\n\"This was a targeted attack against a Tesla facility,\" said Dori Koren, assistant sheriff for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\\n\\nAlong with the burning vehicles, officials said the word \"RESIST\" was spray-painted across the doors of the facility and three rounds of shots were fired at the additional Teslas. The suspect approached the business wearing black clothing and are believed to have used Molotov cocktails and a firearm to conduct his attack, police said.\\n\\nOfficials received notice that an individual had \"set several vehicles on fire in the parking lot and caused damage to the property.\"\\n\\nPolice and the FBI\\'s Joint Terrorism Task Force are investigating this incident, which they believe was an isolated attack. Authorities are still searching for a suspect.\\n\\nTwo Tesla Cybertrucks also caught on fire at a dealership in Kansas City, Missouri, on Monday evening, according to the Kansas City Police Department.\\n\\nTesla vehicles, dealerships and charging stations have been vandalized, suffered arson and faced protests in recent weeks since the company\\'s CEO Elon Musk began his work at the White House spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\\n\\nIn the statement Tuesday, Bondi said, “The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" In some of the cases, she said the Justice Department is charging perpetrators with crimes that carry five-year mandatory minimum sentences.\\n\\n\"We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,\" she said in the statement.\\n\\nIn the Kansas incident, a police officer in the area spotted smoke coming from one Cybertruck at a Tesla dealership on State Line Road shortly before midnight. The officer attempted to put out the flames using a fire extinguisher, but the fire spread to a second Cybertruck parked next to the original one, police said.\\n\\nChalk graffiti is displayed on the outside of a Tesla dealership during a rally in San Francisco, March 15, 2025.

The FBI is assisting the Kansas City Police Department in this investigation.\\n\\nThis follows a spree of similar incidents that have occurred across the country in the last few weeks.\\n\\nLast week, \"more than a dozen\" shots were fired at a Tesla dealership in Tigard, Oregon, according to Kelsey Anderson, the public information officer at the Tigard Police Department.\\n\\nAdditionally, three Teslas were vandalized in Dedham, Massachusetts on March 11, according to the Dedham Police Department. Officials said \"words had been spray-painted\" on two Tesla Cybertrucks, with all four tires of the trucks and a Tesla Model S being \"reportedly damaged.\"\\n\\nATF investigators inspect burned Tesla Cybertrucks at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025. Lindsey Wasson/AP\\n\\nProtests against the company have also occurred at dealerships nationwide.

Musk, whose wealth is overwhelmingly linked to his Tesla holdings, has personally lost $121 billion from his net worth over the past three months.\\n\\nSo what happened? Why hasn’t Musk’s rapid ascent into oligarch territory helped rescue his “baby” (as President Trump called Tesla during the pair’s bizarre ad-like press conference last week on the South Lawn)?\\n\\nThere are two main reasons:\\n\\nTesla sales are cratering around the world, and… Its CEO isn’t doing anything to stop it.\\n\\nWhile Musk is holed up in the EEOB looking for ways to break the federal government, Tesla’s core business is in crisis.\\n\\nThe company reported its first-ever drop in global sales last year, and this year isn’t looking much better. Wall Street analysts from RBC, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Mizuho and JPMorgan have all lowered their delivery forecasts for the company.\\n\\nIn China, in particular, Tesla is struggling to compete against domestic carmakers. Last month Tesla shipments in the country fell 49% year-over-year. Europe sales are also slumping, particularly in Germany, where consumers have been outraged over Musk’s support of a far-right nationalist party with links to Nazis. Sales tumbled 76% in Germany last month from a year earlier.\\n\\nThe news isn’t getting better for Tesla. Its stock got a double-shot of bad news out of China on Monday.\\n\\nIts No. 1 Chinese rival, BYD, unveiled a new charging system that can give its latest model cars 250 miles of ra\\ufeffnge after just five minutes — twice as fast as Tesla’s charging rate.\\n\\nOn the same day, Tesla also launched a free monthlong trial of its “Full Self-Driving” software in China — a sign the company is desperately trying to reverse is declining market share.\\n\\nIts shares fell 5% in the US on Monday and another 5% on Tuesday after RBC lowered its price target in response to growing domestic competition.\\n\\nAll those headaches would amount to a dire problem for Tesla even if it had a normal CEO. But Tesla is run by the MAGA-pilled Musk, whose personal brand has gone from “OK, he’s a bit weird” a few years ago to “OK, he’s posting racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories” in 2025.\\n\\nTesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nA CNN poll last week found that 53% of Americans have a negative view of Musk, while roughly 60% say he has neither the right experience nor the right judgment to make the kinds of sweeping cuts his “department” is carrying out.\\n\\nA used Cybertruck is selling for 58% less than it did a year ago on the resale market. Julio Cortez/AP\\n\\nWhile Tesla is still the best-selling electric vehicle brand in the US, competition is heating up, and Musk’s right-wing authoritarian turn appears to be doing real damage.\\n\\nPrices on pre-owned Teslas are falling at more than double the rate of the average car, according to research by CarGurus. Used cars overall have fallen 2.7% year over year, while used Teslas have declined 7.3%. A used Cybertruck, Tesla’s head-scratching experiment in car design that looks like it was based on a dare, is worth a whopping 58% less on the resale market.\\n\\nAnother report from Cars.com found that while searches for non-Tesla EVs were up 12% year-over-year last month, searches for Teslas have fallen 7%.\\n\\n“We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note to clients last week.\\n\\nAdding fuel to the backlash is a “Tesla Takedown” movement started by activists and spread on social media, advocating that people sell Tesla vehicles, dump the stock and protest at showrooms.\\n\\n“I’m getting rid of this car because I’m embarrassed to drive it,” Joe Romer, a Tesla owner in California, told CNN’s Julia Vargas Jones. “I’m tired of Elon Musk and all this garbage that’s going on.”\\n\\nEven Dan Ives, a tech analyst for Wedbush and historically one of Tesla’s biggest cheerleaders, appears to be losing patience with Musk.\\n\\nLast week, Ives wrote in a note to clients that while he is maintaining his “outperform” rating on the stock, investor patience is “wearing very thin.”\\n\\nBottom line: Wall Street has long been able to tolerate Musk because Tesla was a cutting-edge company with a product lots of people wanted to buy. Investors can look past all kinds of shenanigans if they’re getting a good return on investment.\\n\\nBut what happens when Tesla stops being the dominant player in electric vehicles? And what happens when Musk is too busy trying to fire federal workers to fix it? These are the kinds of questions rattling investors at a time when they already have plenty of nightmare fuel in the form of Trump’s economic agenda.\\n\\nMusk has made his name synonymous with Tesla — a fact that served them both well when Tesla seemed unstoppable and Musk became the world’s richest person.\\n\\nBut Tesla no longer seems unstoppable, and Musk no longer seems stable. That could prove a toxic pairing.', 'Topics': ['musk wealth', 'tesla holdings', 'musk', 'tesla', 'teslas declined'], 'Sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'Title': 'Tesla News', 'Summary': 'Get the latest car

Its stock has surged nonetheless, rising by more than 50% since President Donald Trump was elected, on investor optimism that Musk’s advisory role in the new administration will help the company.\\n\\nIn its letter to shareholders and on the analyst call, Tesla it was hoping to lift sales by driving the cost of its vehicles down, highlighting that one cost measure fell below $35,000, the lowest in its history. It said production of “more affordable” models are expected to start in the first half of the year, with Musk emphasizing that “maximizing volume” was priority.\\n\\nBut then he quickly pivoted in the conference call to other goals and parts of the business, and the stock started climbing.\\n\\n“AI and robotics - that will bear immense fruit,” he said, adding “I see a path, I’m not saying it’s an easy path, but I see a path for Tesla being the most valuable company in the world — by far, not even close,” leapfrogging the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Tesla is currently the seventh-most valuable company in the S&P 500 with a market value of $1.25 trillion.\\n\\nTesla’s unadjusted profits for October through December period were down dramatically, though the year-earlier period was a poor comparison because the results included a large one-time tax benefit. The company said it made $2.31 billion last quarter, down 71% from the $7.93 billion profit in the same period in 2023.\\n\\nRevenue rose 2% to $25.7 billion, less than Wall Street’s forecast of $27.1 billion, according to FactSet. Tesla offered a series of incentives during the quarter to drum up demand for its electric vehicles including low-interest loans and lower prices. Tesla’s gross profit margin fell to 16.3% for the quarter, down 1.3 percentage points from a year earlier.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Tesla said it sold 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, the first drop in more than a dozen years despite offers of 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. The fourth quarter showed signs of a rebound, though, with a record 495,570 vehicles sold.\\n\\n“The bulls got what they wanted, and the bears got data to support them as well,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a big fan of the stock. “But ultimately what will drive the stock is autonomous driving, and this is the bullish I’ve ever heard Musk.”\\n\\nFor the full year, Tesla posted profits before one-time items of $8.42 billion, down 23% from the year earlier.\\n\\nInvestors are expecting that Musk’s close relationship with Trump will translate into lighter regulation on the car company, fewer investigations and help in speeding the development of autonomous driving.\\n\\nBut the Trump administration has also vowed to cut government incentives to customers to buy EVs and says it will loosen emission standards. The latter especially could hurt Tesla because it has a big business in selling “regulatory credits” to other automakers that fall short of the standards.\\n\\nThe latest financial report showed that in the fourth quarter Tesla sold $692 million in these credits, a spigot of cash that could be turned off if Trump follows through on his vow.', 'Topics': ['tesla offered', 'tesla sold', 'tesla', 'hurt tesla', 'quarter tesla'], 'Sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'Title': \"Attorney general calls Tesla arson attacks 'nothing short of domestic terrorism'\", 'Summary': 'A member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is calling the recent spate of arson attacks and vandalism against Tesla vehicles \"nothing short of domestic terrorism\" and promising harsh punishments for perpetrators if they are caught.', 'Content': 'A member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, March 10, 2025.\\n\\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is calling the recent spate of arson attacks and vandalism against Tesla vehicles \"nothing short of domestic terrorism\" and promising harsh punishments for perpetrators if they are caught.\\n\\nThe statement from Bondi came after the latest incident in which five Tesla vehicles were damaged when a fire was started at a Tesla Collision Center in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\\n\\nNew York CNN —\\n\\nElon Musk’s DC power grab hasn’t been the Tesla-stock jet fuel investors were expecting.\\n\\nTesla shares have fallen more than 40% since January — erasing all of the “Trump bump” that briefly saw the stock gain more than 90% after Election Day. Musk, whose wealth is overwhelmingly linked to his Tesla holdings, has personally lost $121 billion from his net worth over the past three months.\\n\\nSo what happened? Why hasn’t Musk’s rapid ascent into oligarch territory helped rescue his “baby” (as President Trump called Tesla during the pair’s bizarre ad-like press conference last week on the South Lawn)?\\n\\nThere are two main reasons:\\n\\nTesla sales are cratering around the world, and… Its CEO isn’t doing anything to stop it.\\n\\nWhile Musk is holed up in the EEOB looking for ways to break the federal government, Tesla’s core business is in crisis.\\n\\nThe company reported its first-ever drop in global sales last year, and this year isn’t looking much better. Wall Street analysts from RBC, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Mizuho and JPMorgan have all lowered their delivery forecasts for the company.\\n\\nIn China, in particular, Tesla is struggling to compete against domestic carmakers. Last month Tesla shipments in the country fell 49% year-over-year. Europe sales are also slumping, particularly in Germany, where consumers have been outraged over Musk’s support of a far-right nationalist party with links to Nazis. Sales tumbled 76% in Germany last month from a year earlier.\\n\\nThe news isn’t getting better for Tesla. Its stock got a double-shot of bad news out of China on Monday.\\n\\nIts No. 1 Chinese rival, BYD, unveiled a new charging system that can give its latest model cars 250 miles of ra\\ufeffnge after just five minutes — twice as fast as Tesla’s charging rate.\\n\\nOn the same day, Tesla also launched a free monthlong trial of its “Full Self-Driving” software in China — a sign the company is desperately trying to reverse is declining market share.\\n\\nIts shares fell 5% in the US on Monday and another 5% on Tuesday after RBC lowered its price target in response to growing domestic competition.\\n\\nAll those headaches would amount to a dire problem for Tesla even if it had a normal CEO. But Tesla is run by the MAGA-pilled Musk, whose personal brand has gone from “OK, he’s a bit weird” a few years ago to “OK, he’s posting racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories” in 2025.\\n\\nTesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nA CNN poll last week found that 53% of Americans have a negative view of Musk, while roughly 60% say he has neither the right experience nor the right judgment to make the kinds of sweeping cuts his “department” is carrying out.\\n\\nA used Cybertruck is selling for 58% less than it did a year ago on the resale market. Julio Cortez/AP\\n\\nWhile Tesla is still the best-selling electric vehicle brand in the US, competition is heating up, and Musk’s right-wing authoritarian turn appears to be doing real damage.\\n\\nPrices on pre-owned Teslas are falling at more than double the rate of the average car, according to research by CarGurus. Used cars overall have fallen 2.7% year over year, while used Teslas have declined 7.3%. A used Cybertruck, Tesla’s head-scratching experiment in car design that looks like it was based on a dare, is worth a whopping 58% less on the resale market.\\n\\nAnother report from Cars.com found that while searches for non-Tesla EVs were up 12% year-over-year last month, searches for Teslas have fallen 7%.\\n\\n“We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note to clients last week.\\n\\nAdding fuel to the backlash is a “Tesla Takedown” movement started by activists and spread on social media, advocating that people sell Tesla vehicles, dump the stock and protest at showrooms.\\n\\n“I’m getting rid of this car because I’m embarrassed to drive it,” Joe Romer, a Tesla owner in California, told CNN’s Julia Vargas Jones. “I’m tired of Elon Musk and all this garbage that’s going on.”\\n\\nEven Dan Ives, a tech analyst for Wedbush and historically one of Tesla’s biggest cheerleaders, appears to be losing patience with Musk.\\n\\nLast week, Ives wrote in a note to clients that while he is maintaining his “outperform” rating on the stock, investor patience is “wearing very thin.”\\n\\nBottom line: Wall Street has long been able to tolerate Musk because Tesla was a cutting-edge company with a product lots of people wanted to buy. Investors can look past all kinds of shenanigans if they’re getting a good return on investment.\\n\\nBut what happens when Tesla stops being the dominant player in electric vehicles? And what happens when Musk is too busy trying to fire federal workers to fix it? These are the kinds of questions rattling investors at a time when they already have plenty of nightmare fuel in the form of Trump’s economic agenda.\\n\\nMusk has made his name synonymous with Tesla — a fact that served them both well when Tesla seemed unstoppable and Musk became the world’s richest person.\\n\\nBut Tesla no longer seems unstoppable, and Musk no longer seems stable.
